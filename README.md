ArchaeoSTOR
===========
ArchaeoSTOR is a web-based archaeological data management and geographical information system designed to cover both data collection in field sites and data analysis on campus. It provides artifacts' metadata management and map-based visual analysis.

The system was developed with [Grails](http://grails.org/), [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/), and [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/). Some of the code were written in Jordanian desert when I participated an archaeological expedition :)
